                    <p>7.1. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Alma Lasers, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, subcontractors, and agents from and against any claim, damage, or loss, including reasonable court costs, attorneys’ fees, and any fines that may be incurred, that arise directly or indirectly from your: (a) breach of these Terms, including any of your representations or warranties, whether by you or by anyone using your account or device, and whether or not that use was authorized by you; (b) use or misuse of the Services; (c) violation of any law or regulation, including breach of applicable data protection laws; and (d) infringement of any right of any third party
                    </p>
                    <p>7.2. We agree to indemnify, defend, and hold you harmless from and against any claim, damage, or loss or loss, including reasonable court costs, attorneys’ fees, and any fines that you may incur in connection with any actual or threatened claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any third party arising from or relating to a claim that the Services, as delivered, infringe any patent or copyright or misappropriate any trade secret, provided however, that we shall have no responsibility or liability for any claim to the extent resulting from or arising out of (a) the use of the Services not in compliance with these Terms or applicable law; (b) the combination of the Services with any services that we did not provide; (c) the modification of the Services by any party other than us; or (d) the use of any version of the Services that is not the most up-to-date version.</p>
                    <p>7.3. Either party claiming indemnification under this Section (“Indemnitee”) shall: (i) provide the other party (“Indemnifying Party”) with written notice of a claim promptly upon becoming aware thereof, (ii) allow Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of Indemnitee if such settlement would require any action on the part of Indemnitee and further provided that Indemnitee may engage its own counsel at its own expense; and (iii) reasonably cooperate with Indemnifying Party, at Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.</p>
                    <h5>8<strong> Disclaimers</strong></h5>
                    <p>8.1. OTHER THAN THE WARRANTIES MADE EXPLICITLY IN THESE TERMS, WE DO NOT MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES (IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE) ABOUT THE SITE, SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE OF GOOD QUALITY, USEFUL FOR YOUR OR CUSTOMER’S, AS APPLICABLE, SPECIFIC NEEDS OR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURATE, ERROR-FREE (OR THAT ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED), RELIABLE, SECURE, COMPLETE, NON-INFRINGING, OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.</p>
                    <p>8.2. We cannot control the functionality of services provided by third parties and assume no responsibility for any telephone or network line failure or interruption, or traffic congestion on the Internet or on the Services themselves. We cannot control the actions of bad actors and do not guarantee that we will successfully prevent unauthorized access to or alteration of the Services.</p>
                    <p>8.3. You understand that using the Services entails some degree of risk. When you choose to use the Services, you do so at your sole discretion and risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties and therefore some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. Check your local laws for any restrictions regarding the exclusion of implied warranties</p>
                    <h5>9<strong> Limitation of Liability </strong></h5>
                    <p> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALMA LASERS (AND ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR SUBCONTRACTORS) SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS THAT IS NOT A DIRECT RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT ALMA LASERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR MAXIMUM LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED A CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF USD $50.
                    </p>
                    <h5>10 <strong>Term and Termination</strong></h5>
                    <p>These Terms will take effect when you first use our Site or Services and shall continue in full force and effect until they are terminated in one of the ways described below. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account in the Partner Zone or Customer Portal (and, by association, these Terms) at any time and for any reason by providing three days’ prior notice. We also have the right to suspend or terminate these Terms immediately if you violate the letter or spirit of these Terms or you engage in fraudulent, abusive, or illegal behavior or harass or harm other users, third parties, or our business interests. Even if these terms are terminated, you will still be bound by the sections of these Terms which, by their nature are meant to survive termination.</p>
                    <h5>11 <strong>Force Majeure</strong></h5>
                    <p>Neither party will be liable for any default or delay in its performance of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent caused by a natural disaster, act of God, act of war or terrorism, riot, third-party labor strike, pandemic, or other similar occurrence beyond its reasonable control, provided that the affected party makes all reasonable efforts to comply with its obligations despite the occurrence. The affected party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the other party of the occurrence. It is clarified that payment obligations hereunder may be delayed due to a force majeure event but will not be excused.</p>
                    <h5>12 <strong>Notices</strong></h5>
                    <p>To provide an official notice in accordance with these Terms, either us or you may send a notice by courier, registered mail, or by email to the addresses we provide each other. Either party may assume its notice has been received one after: (1) business day following delivery by courier, four (4) business days following delivery by registered mail, and one (1) business day after email transmission.</p>
                    <h5>13 <strong>General</strong></h5>
                    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and you regarding our Services, and any and all other agreements existing between us regarding the Services are hereby terminated. We may assign our rights and obligations in these Terms to any third party. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations in these Terms to anyone else and any attempt to do so will be void. If either party waives any rights regarding any breach or default of these Terms, that waiver shall not be deemed to waive any other breach or default. The courts in the State of Israel shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes regarding these Terms. The laws of the State of Israel shall govern these Terms without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods. In the event that a court rules that a provision of these Terms is unenforceable, that provision shall be replaced with an enforceable provision which most closely achieves the effect of the original and the remaining terms of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, employment, joint venture, or partnership relationship between us and you, and nothing in these Terms enables you to act on our behalf.</p>
